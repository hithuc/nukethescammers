# Interactive Blog to check concept of Crowd-Vigilant Scam Protection

 Scams such as false YouTube Giveaways have to attract hundreds or thousands of viewers to be successful.

 Technical solutions could automate detection of Scam Videos but require development and many views to design and train the systems.  
 Meanwhile people lose money and the credibility of the mimicked projects suffers.

 Can we use the crowds viewing scam videos to protect and prevent the scams? 
 Many views are required for these scams to work and there are probably at least 10 times as many viewers as victims. 

 A natural analogy would be the thousands of wildebeest strolling past prides of lions.  
 The lions feed on the sick and young in the same way that the scammers feed on the sleep-deprived and inexperienced.

 The analogy breaks down when comparing the King of Beasts to the scum who pervert their skills to prey on the hopes of often desperate fellow human beings.

 Can we gamify the task by providing teams of scam hunters with incentives such as badges, accolades and cold hard cash or crypto?

 Scams are bad news for the projects mimicked by the scammers. These projects may be happy to offer rewards to teams of scam 'nukers'.
 
 I started this blog on Substack but I created this Repo to get fresh skills and see which processes can be automated.  
 I've been a dinosaur in a SAP ABAP silo for too long. 

 I'm interested in learning Haskell and may follow up with SQL3 and Purescript or Imba for the Front-End.  
 If anyone with relevant skills wants to collaborate, give me a shout!

 Video giveaway scams won't go away quickly because the companies providing the platforms aren't directly hurt by them.  
 This could be the basis of a viable project.
